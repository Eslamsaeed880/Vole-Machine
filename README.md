# Vole-Machine
This is a C++ Machine Language Simulator that models basic computer architecture, including Memory, Registers, ALU, CU, and CPU. It can load instructions from a file, decode, execute them, and simulate data processing at the hardware levelâ€”ideal for learning how low-level systems work.
